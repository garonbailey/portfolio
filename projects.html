				<h3>Rails + Angular: <a href="https://secret-bayou-3108.herokuapp.com/">Mood Adjuster</a></h3>
				<a href="https://secret-bayou-3108.herokuapp.com/"><img src="img/mood.png"></a>
				<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI">the Giphy API</a> to pull a semi-randomized gif based upon the user input into a form. Built with a Ruby on Rails back-end framework with an Angular single-page front-end framework.</p>

				<h3>MEAN Stack: <a href="https://watch-listed.herokuapp.com">watchListed</a></h3>
				<p>This is a full MEAN stack app where a user can create an account to store a list of movies they want to watch. I use <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">the OMDb API</a> to search films, which a user can then store and view the list. Upon viewing, they can delete the movie from their list. <i>In Progress</i></p>

				<h3><a href="http://scicollab.com">SciCollab</a></h3>
				<p>This is a scientific research collaboration website. Built on Node and Express with a Mongo database, users can sign up and create research projects where they can add collaborators who all have updating access to the project. <i>In Progress</i></p>
